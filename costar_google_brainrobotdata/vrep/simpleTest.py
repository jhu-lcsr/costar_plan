# Make sure to have the server side running in V-REP: 
# in a child script of a V-REP scene, add following command
# to be executed just once, at simulation start:
#
# simExtRemoteApiStart(19999)
#
# then start simulation, and run this program.
#
# IMPORTANT: for each successful call to simxStart, there
# should be a corresponding call to simxFinish at the end!

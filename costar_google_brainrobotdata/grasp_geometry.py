    # Params

    depth_image:
        width x height x depth image in floating point format
    camera_intrinsics_matrix:
        'camera/intrinsics/matrix33' The 3x3 camera intrinsics matrix.
    camera_T_base:
        'camera/transforms/camera_T_base/matrix44'
        4x4 transformation matrix from the camera center to the robot base.
        camera_T_base is a transform that takes a point in the base
        frame of reference and transforms it to the camera frame of reference.
    base_T_endeffector_current: A vector quaternion array from a base frame to an end effector frame
        vector (x, y, z) for cartesian motion and quaternion (qx, qy, qz, qw) for rotation.
        base_T_endeffector is a transform that takes a point in the endeffector
        frame of reference and transforms it to the base frame of reference at the current time step
        of the grasp attempt move_to_grasp sequence.
    base_T_endeffector_final: A vector quaternion array from a base frame to an end effector frame
        containing the proposed destination of the robot at the final time step of the grasp attempt
        move_to_grasp sequence.

    augmentation_rectangle:
       A random offset for the selected (dx, dy) pixel index.
       It will randomly select a pixel in a box around the endeffector coordinate.
       Default (1, 1) has no augmentation.

        Note: endeffector_current_to_endeffector_final is abbreviated eectf.

        end_surface_relative_transform_pose is a numpy array pose [x, y, z, qx, qy, qz, qw],
        relative to the final time step  which contains:
           - vector (x, y, z) for cartesian motion
           - quaternion (qx, qy, qz, qw) for rotation

        The image_coordinate (dx, dy) is the pixel width, height
        coordinate of the transform in the depth image.

        image_coordinate is used to calculate the point cloud point used for the
        surface relative transform and to generate 2D label weights.

            from the measured surface, alongside a single rotation angle theta containing sin(theta), cos(theta).
